## Setup
### Installation
To use the tool, install it via pip:

```bash
pip install burst2safe
```

Or conda:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge burst2safe
```

### Credentials
To use `burst2safe`, you must provide your Earthdata Login credentials via two environment variables 
(`EARTHDATA_USERNAME` and `EARTHDATA_PASSWORD`), or via your `.netrc` file.

If you do not already have an Earthdata account, you can sign up [here](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/home). 

If you would like to set up Earthdata Login via your `.netrc` file, check out this [guide](https://harmony.earthdata.nasa.gov/docs#getting-started) to get started.

## burst2safe usage
The `burst2safe` command line tool can be run using the following structure:
```bash
burst2safe --orbit 32861 --extent 53.57 27.54 53.78 27.60
```
Where:

* `--orbit` is the absolute orbit number of the Sentinel-1 data.
* `--extent` is the area of interest as a bounding box in the format `minlon minlat maxlon maxlat` or as a path to a GDAL-compatible vector file.

You can specify the `--pols` argument to select the desired polarizations to include. The options are `VV`, `VH`, `HV`, and `HH`. The default is `VV`.

You can specify the `--swaths` argument to select the desired swaths to include. The options are `IW1`, `IW2`, and `IW3` for IW mode bursts and `EW1`, `EW2`, `EW3`, `EW4`, and `EW5` for EW mode bursts. The default is to include all swaths.

You can specify the `--mode` argument to select the desired acquisition mode to find bursts for. The options are `IW` for interferometric wide swath mode and `EW` for extra wide swath mode. The default is `IW` mode.

You can also specify a minimum number of bursts per polarization/swath combination using the `--min-bursts` argument.
The `--min-bursts` argument is useful for workflows that require a minimum number of bursts, such as Enhanced Spectral Diversity (ESD) processing within InSAR processing chains.

> [!WARNING]
> To create SAFEs compatible with [ISCE3/s1-reader](https://github.com/isce-framework/s1-reader), **you must use the `--all-anns`** flag. The `s1-reader` package requires metadata information from neighboring swaths to perform some corrections, so the `--all-anns` flags must be used to include all product annotation datasets, regardless of the bursts selected, in the SAFE file.

For more control over the burst group, you can also provide specific burst granule IDs to be merged into a SAFE file using the following structure:
```bash
burst2safe S1_136231_IW2_20200604T022312_VV_7C85-BURST S1_136232_IW2_20200604T022315_VV_7C85-BURST
```
This search is equivalent to the previous search.
To be eligible for processing, all burst granules must:

1. Have the same acquisition mode
1. Be from the same absolute orbit
1. Be contiguous in time and space.
1. Have the same footprint for all polarizations.

The tool should raise an error if any of these conditions are not met.

The output SAFE file will be created in the directory specified using the `--output-dir` argument, which defaults to the current directory.

## burst2stack usage
For those who want to create stacks of SAFEs (SAFEs covering the same region but from different dates), we have created the `burst2stack` tool. This tool has a similar structure as `burst2safe`, but with small changes to the CLI arguments.

This includes:
- Exclusion of the granules pathway
- Specifying the relative instead of absolute orbit number
- Adding a start date and end date argument

An example command that runs `burst2stack` for the same area as the previous examples, but for a range of dates can be seen below:
```bash
burst2stack --rel-orbit 64 --start-date 2020-06-03 --end-date 2020-06-17 --extent 53.57 27.54 53.78 27.60
```
The usage of the `--extent`, `--pols`, `--swaths`, `--min-bursts`, and `--all-anns` arguments is the same as in `burst2safe`.

## Strategy
`burst2safe` combines and reformats individual bursts into a SAFE file following the procedure described in the [Sentinel-1 Product Specification Document](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-1-sar/document-library/-/asset_publisher/1dO7RF5fJMbd/content/sentinel-1-product-specification-from-ipf-360?_com_liferay_asset_publisher_web_portlet_AssetPublisherPortlet_INSTANCE_1dO7RF5fJMbd_assetEntryId=4846613&_com_liferay_asset_publisher_web_portlet_AssetPublisherPortlet_INSTANCE_1dO7RF5fJMbd_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fsentinel.esa.int%2Fweb%2Fsentinel%2Fuser-guides%2Fsentinel-1-sar%2Fdocument-library%3Fp_p_id%3Dcom_liferay_asset_publisher_web_portlet_AssetPublisherPortlet_INSTANCE_1dO7RF5fJMbd%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26_com_liferay_asset_publisher_web_portlet_AssetPublisherPortlet_INSTANCE_1dO7RF5fJMbd_assetEntryId%3D4846613%26_com_liferay_asset_publisher_web_portlet_AssetPublisherPortlet_INSTANCE_1dO7RF5fJMbd_cur%3D0%26p_r_p_resetCur%3Dfalse)
In this document, ESA describes how to create an Assembled Sentinel-1 Level 1 product from individual Sentinel-1 Level 1 SAFEs. We use this same strategy to combine ASF-extracted burst SLC products into a SAFE file that should be compatible with any SAR processor currently capable of using Sentinel-1 Level SAFEs. For in-depth technical details of the implementation, we refer you to the Sentinel-1 Product Specification document above. However, it is important to know that ESA recommends merging Sentinel-1 data/metadata components using three primary strategies:

### Include
A given data/metadata component is the same for all data slices, and any value can be used (i.e., polarization).

For `Include` components, the value associated with the earliest burst is always used.

### Concatenate
A given data/metadata component is a series of time-ordered fields that can be combined into a single list (i.e., ground control points).

For `Concatenate` components, the fields are merged and subset to the start/stop times of the included bursts. Where present `line` sub-fields have also been updated.

### Merge
A given data/metadata component must be recalculated using a process unique to each component (i.e., platform heading).

For `Merge` components, we have made the best effort to follow the merging instructions outlined in the product specification. While we hope to eventually correctly reconstruct all merged fields, there are some components for whom the implementation is unclear. In these cases, we have set the values of these fields to NULL (`''`) so that downstream processors raise errors instead of using incorrect values. **If any fields we have omitted in this way cause your application to fail, let us know so that we can prioritize its development!**

### Deviations from Specification
In some cases, we were not able to recreate certain datasets or metadata fields in the exact way that the IPF computes them, because the creation process is unknown to us, or utilizes data that we do not have access to. This includes datasets such as all datasets in the SAFE `preview` directory the SAFE report PDF included with each SAFE file, some metadata fields in the annotation datasets.

A full accounting of omitted datasets and differing fields can be found below:

* Annotation
    * Noise
        * No intentional omissions or deviations.
    * Calibration
        * No intentional omissions or deviations
    * RFI
        * No intentional omissions or deviations.
    * Product
        * `generalAnnotation/productInformation/platformHeading`
            - calculated as average of input Level 1 SLCs, not recalculated from Level-0 slices.
        * `imageAnnotation/imageInformation/azimuthPixelSpacing`
            - calculated as average of input Level 1 SLCs, not Level-0 slices.
        * `imageAnnotation/imageInformation/imageStatistics/outputDataMean` / `outputDataStdDev`
            - calculated using `np.mean`/`np.std` on valid data.
* Measurement GeoTIFFs
    * Invalid data as denoted by `swathTiming/burstList/burst/firstValidSample` and `lastValidSample` are set to zero. This done by the ASF extractor, not this tool.
    * TIFF tags **that are not GeoTIFF tags** are omitted. See Product Specification Table 3-8 for full list.
* Preview
    * The quick-look.png file is omitted.
* Manifest
    * Some elements may not be in the same order as standard S1 SAFE files.
* SAFE report
    * The SAFE report PDF is omitted.

### IPF Version Compatibility
At this time, we are not aware of any compatibility issues with older Sentinel-1 Instrument Processing Facility (IPF) versions. However, if you do encounter any incompatibilities [please open an issue](https://github.com/forrestfwilliams/burst2safe/issues/new), so we can fix it!

## Developer Setup
1. Ensure that conda is installed on your system (we recommend using [mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) to reduce setup times).
2. Download a local version of the `burst2safe` repository (`git clone https://github.com/forrestfwilliams/burst2safe.git`)
3. In the base directory for this project call `mamba env create -f environment.yml` to create your Python environment, then activate it (`mamba activate burst2safe`)
4. Finally, install a development version of the package (`python -m pip install -e .`)

To run all commands in sequence use:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/forrestfwilliams/burst2safe.git
cd burst2safe
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate burst2safe
